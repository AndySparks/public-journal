- [The Art of Possibility: Transforming Professional and Personal Life](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Possibility-Transforming-Professional-Personal/dp/0142001104) -- Whatever you do, LISTEN TO THE AUDIOBOOK VERSION. The two authors narrate it, and it is absolutely lovely. Seth Godin says he listens to part of this book every month. 
- [The Artist's Way](https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Way-25th-Anniversary/dp/0143129252) -- read this book over a ~10 week period. If you only do one of the exercises in this book, I recommend doing "morning pages." My second favorite exercise from the book is the "artist's date," where you take yourself on a date 1x a week!
- All four books in Alan Sieler's ["Coaching to the Human Soul"](http://www.newfieldinstitute.com.au/html/books_chsI.html) series.
  - Sometimes an affordable copy of these books shows up on Amazon, but otherwise you have to order them from Australia. They're like $60 / ea. and 100% worth it.
