🅀 “There’s nothing intrinsic about the manual trades when it comes to generating this
particular source of meaning.
Any pursuit—be it physical or cognitive—that supports high levels of skill can also
generate a sense of sacredness.”
—Cal Newport, *Deep Work*[^1]

In my century-old house, the hinges on every door are covered in layers of paint.
For a hundred years, the people painting this house refused to find a screwdriver or to
tape around the hinges, dooming me to stare at this mess.
On Holloway’s Work-From-Home Wednesday this week, around 5 o’clock PM, some part of me
snapped. I had to go nuclear on those suckers, strip them down to the brass I knew lay
below the strata of practical beiges, “Careful Whisper” blues, and a hundred other bad
decisions and attempts to mask them.

On the way to the hardware store with plans to strip every hinge in the house, and sand a
quarter inch off the bottom of a door that kept catching on the carpet, my brain
confronted me.
“Is there a better use of your evening?
How ‘bout taking something off the top of your to-do list, brother?
Something urgent and important or, hell, leave urgent out of the equation and go with
something plain old important.”
As if sitting across the table from a colleague, I thought back to myself, “Great point,
but [how about no?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lITBGjNEp08)” The rest of the night, as I
sanded and boiled off the latex and lord knows what they used to paint in the 1920’s
(yeah, I know, freaking lead), I kept asking myself, “What on Earth are you doing this
for?”

Some call this
[Yak Shaving](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/YakShavingDefinedIllGetThatDoneAsSoonAsIShaveThisYak.aspx),
portrayed with brilliance in *Malcolm in the Middle* with
[Hal fixing a light bulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0). See, my *actual work*,
you know, the stuff I spend fifty or sixty hours a week doing and getting paid for,
consists of jumping between product design, writing-to-think, writing-to-publish, internal
and external meetings, spreadsheets for finance, spreadsheets for marketing, and no
shortage of staring out the window while waiting for my thoughts to fall into place like
[Teewees and Orange Rickies](https://www.joe.co.uk/gaming/tetris-block-names-221127) onto the
cool blue infinite of my entire life.
Rarely does my work afford me the twin pleasures of starting something and finishing it in
a day, and *oh my god it’s a real thing I can touch, point to, or use, something done.*

In the end, I got down to brass.
As I cleaned the sawdust out of every cavity of my home, muscles aching from handling and
sanding the beast of the old door, I realized how important it is to me to have that
tactile achievement, every once in a while, to have something to point to and say, “I did
that.” I had only improved minute details I doubt others will ever notice.
Certainly, no one’s saying thank you.
But what is Good Work at any level, from building a company to raising a skyscraper, if
not work done with patience and dedication?
A conscientious commitment to steady, incremental progress, week after week, for years at
a time? If infinite regress is “turtles all the way down,” maybe progress is just
polishing hinges.

### This Week

#### Polishing Hinges

- Last week, I tweeted “[Who has taught you something that will stick with you forever? What was it?](https://twitter.com/SparksZilla/status/1178385532906176512?s=20)”
  The replies are a fun read.
- “[Three Big Things: The Most Important Forces Shaping the World](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/three-big-things-the-most-important-forces-shaping-the-world/)”
  by Morgan Housel was an informative Saturday morning read this week.
- *[If This Isn’t Nice, What Is? (Much) Expanded Second Edition: The Graduation Speeches and Other Words to Live By](https://www.amazon.com/This-Isnt-Nice-Expanded-Second/dp/1609806972)*
  by Kurt Vonnegut is my favorite discovery of the last three years.
  I promise you won’t regret the time you invest in reading Vonnegut’s graduation speeches.
- To avoid yak shaving, give “[Fierce Prioritization](https://feld.com/archives/2019/09/fierce-prioritization.html)”
  by Brad Feld a read.
  It’s quick but powerful.
- At some level, polishing hinges has to do with being comfortable slogging through the
  parts of Good Work that aren’t exciting to share with your significant other at the end of
  a day.
  *[The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick)](https://www.amazon.com/Dip-Little-Book-Teaches-Stick/dp/1591841666)*,
  by Seth Godin, is a good resource for wrapping your head around the struggle of the slog.
- While I haven’t read it, others recommend
  *[The Messy Middle: Finding Your Way Through the Hardest and Most Crucial Part of Any Bold Venture](https://www.amazon.com/Messy-Middle-Finding-Through-Hardest/dp/0735218072)*,
  by Scott Belsky, to me all the time, and it’s made it onto my “next up of non-fiction”
  list. It seems like the sister book to *The Dip*.

That’s Good Work for this week.
Looking forward to what’s next.
