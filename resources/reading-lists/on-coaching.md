## Books

### Essentials
- [Coaching Skills: A Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Coaching-Skills-Handbook-Jenny-Rogers/dp/0335245595): This book is the most nuts and bolts, practical guide for beginners I've come across thus far.
- [The Completely Revised Handbook of Coaching: A Developmental Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Completely-Revised-Handbook-Coaching-Developmental/dp/047090674X)
- [Building a Coaching Business, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Coaching-Business-Rogers-author/dp/0335227007)
- [Self as Coach, Self as Leader: Developing the Best in You to Develop the Best in Others](https://www.amazon.com/Self-Coach-Leader-Developing-Develop/dp/1119562554/)
- [Transitions: Making Sense of Life's Changes](https://www.amazon.com/Transitions-Making-Sense-Lifes-Changes-dp-0738285404/dp/0738285404/ref=dp_ob_title_bk)
- [Learning in Relationship](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Relationship-Foundation-Personal-Professional/dp/1887259015)
- [Helping People Change](https://www.amazon.com/Helping-People-Change-Coaching-Compassion/dp/1633696561): A great book covering research on how people make changes.
- [Presence-Based Coaching: Cultivating Self-Generative Leaders Through Mind, Body, and Heart](https://www.amazon.com/Presence-Based-Coaching-Cultivating-Self-Generative-Leaders/dp/0470325097)
  
### Expanded Curriculum
- [Thanks for the Feedback](https://www.amazon.com/Thanks-Feedback-Science-Receiving-Well/dp/0670014664): Terrific book on giving and receiving feedback. 
- [Crossing the Unknown Sea: Work as a Pilgrimage of Identity](https://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Sea-Work-Pilgrimage-Identity/dp/1573229148)
- [The Art of Possibility: Transforming Professional and Personal Life](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Possibility-Transforming-Professional-Personal/dp/0142001104) -- Whatever you do, LISTEN TO THE AUDIOBOOK VERSION. The two authors narrate it, and it is absolutely lovely. Seth Godin says he listens to part of this book every month. 
- [The Artist's Way](https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Way-25th-Anniversary/dp/0143129252) -- read this book over a ~10 week period. If you only do one of the exercises in this book, I recommend doing "morning pages." My second favorite exercise from the book is the "artist's date," where you take yourself on a date 1x a week!
- All four books in Alan Sieler's ["Coaching to the Human Soul"](http://www.newfieldinstitute.com.au/html/books_chsI.html) series.
  - Sometimes an affordable copy of these books shows up on Amazon, but otherwise you have to order them from Australia. They're like $60 / ea. and 100% worth it.
